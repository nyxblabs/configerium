### üöÄ Enhancements

  - **github): add funding.yml and issue templates for bug report, feature request, and typo ‚ú® feat(vscode:** Add settings.json with editor preferences and eslint auto-fix on save The commit adds a funding.yml file and issue templates for bug report, feature request, and typo. These templates help contributors to create issues that are more structured and easier to understand. The commit also adds a settings.json file with editor preferences and eslint auto-fix on save. This helps contributors to maintain a consistent code style and avoid common errors. ([1bab53c](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/1bab53c))
  - **linting:** Add ESLint configuration and ignore files ESLint configuration has been added to the project with the "@nyxb" configuration extending the recommended rules for TypeScript. The "unicorn/prevent-abbreviations" and "@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion" rules have been disabled. The ".eslintignore" file has been created to ignore the "dist", "node_modules", and "README.md" files. ([ea5f948](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/ea5f948))
  - **dotenv.ts:** Add dotenv module to load and interpolate environment variables The dotenv module is added to load and interpolate environment variables into the process.env object. The setupDotenv function is used to fill the process.env object with the environment variables loaded from the .env file. The loadDotenv function is used to load the environment variables into an object. The interpolate function is used to interpolate variables within .env. The options object is used to specify the project root directory, the file to look in for environment variables, whether to interpolate variables within .env, and an object describing environment variables. ([c17f98c](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/c17f98c))
  - **index.ts, watch.ts:** Add support for watching configuration files and reloading configuration on change The `watchConfig` function has been added to watch configuration files and reload the configuration when changes are detected. The function uses the `chokidar` package to watch the configuration files and reloads the configuration using the `loadConfig` function. The function also provides options to handle hot module replacement (HMR) and to execute callbacks when changes are detected. The `watchConfig` function returns a `ConfigWatcher` object that contains the current configuration and a method to stop watching the configuration files. The `index.ts` file has also been updated to export the necessary types and functions. ([5eb6455](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/5eb6455))
  - **vitest.config.ts:** Add configuration for test coverage reporters This commit adds a new configuration file for vitest, which defines the coverage reporters to be used for the tests. The reporters are set to 'text', 'clover', and 'json'. This will allow for better visibility into the test coverage results. ([dfee5cf](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/dfee5cf))
  - **test:** Add new files and tests for configerium Added new files and tests for configerium. The changes include adding new files such as `.configrc`, `.env`, `.gitignore`, `config.dev.ts`, `config.ts`, `node_modules/configerium-npm-test/config.ts`, `node_modules/configerium-npm-test/package.json`, `package.json`, and `theme/config.ts`. The tests include loading fixture config and extending from a git repo. Also added a new file `types.ts` to test the types of the config object. ([518fc2f](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/518fc2f))
  - **configrc:** Add .configrc file with testConfig=true A new file named .configrc was created with a single line that sets the testConfig variable to true. This file can be used to store configuration variables that are used in the application. ([6355ed8](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/6355ed8))
  - **cover-github-configerium.png:** Add cover image for Configerium GitHub repository The cover image for the Configerium GitHub repository has been added to the .github/assets directory. This image will be used as the cover image for the repository. ([5ec1fb3](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/5ec1fb3))
  - **README.md:** Add documentation for Configerium package This commit adds a comprehensive README.md file for the Configerium package. It includes a description of the package, its features, usage, options, loading priority, extending configuration, environment-specific configuration, and watching configuration. It also includes badges for npm version, downloads, bundle size, and license. ([99dd092](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/99dd092))

  - **.eslintrc): disable unused-imports/no-unused-vars rule üöÄ feat(package.json): add consolji and update dependencies üéâ feat(playground:** Add load.ts and watch.ts files to test the library The unused-imports/no-unused-vars rule is disabled in the .eslintrc file. The consolji package is added to the dependencies in the package.json file, and the dependencies are updated. The load.ts and watch.ts files are added to the playground directory to test the library. ([f7ba7eb](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/f7ba7eb))
  - **package.json:** Add new scripts for prepack, build, dev, lint, lint:fix, release, test, and test:types This commit adds new scripts to the package.json file. The prepack and build scripts are added to run the unbuild command before building the package. The dev script is added to run the vitest dev command. The lint and lint:fix scripts are added to run the eslint command with and without the --fix flag, respectively. The release script is added to run the nyxr test, nyxlx changelogen@latest --release, pnpm publish, and git push --follow-tags commands. The test and test:types scripts are added to run the vitest run --coverage and tsc --noEmit commands, respectively. ([f1d17d3](https://github.com/nyxblabs/configerium/commit/f1d17d3))
  - **package.json): update dependencies üî® refactor(index.test.ts:** Replace absolute paths with relative paths The package.json file was updated to include newer versions of the dependencies. The index.test.ts file was refactored to replace the absolute paths with relative paths to improve portability and make the tests run on different machines.
